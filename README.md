# QADG
  QADG (Questionably Ample Database Grinder) â€” The only static site generator you will ever need!
  
## Minimum Viable Product
* A script that allows you to administrate a webpage using nothing but a code editor and the filesystem
* Templating should be very easy
* Using precompilers for HTML and CSS should be supported
* Output CSS and JS should be minified in the process
* The script should generate a static HTML webpage directory with all assets, scripts and styles

## Future Goals
* Auto sync to remote FTP/SFTP host
* Minimize and crop image assets (thumbnail creation?)
